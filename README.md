# Password-Generator

## Description

This password generator allows the user to customise their own password within a given length.
It has been disgned to show a few key concepts that Javascript can offer. I have included variables, prompts, if, if else statements, for loops, functions, event listeners and query selectors.

## Installation

To access the password generator and have first hand usage then follow this link [nils224.github.io](https://nils224.github.io).

## Usage
To generate a password, select the type of characters you wish to include in your password.
Then click "Generate password" and choose the length you desire in the prompt box.
To copy the generated password click "Copy to Clipboard".
